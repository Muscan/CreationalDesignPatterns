PRO - when dealing complex object that require a lot of parameters
    - when trying to prevent mistakes from creating a complex object
    - when trying to avoid unreadable, big constructors that are sometime required for complex objects creation.
The builder pattern is:

a technique that is widely used by software engineers when trying to manage the creation of complex

objects.

But what exactly do we need to use the builder?

Well, our situation would be when trying to create complex objects, that requires a lot of parameters,

especially when those parameters need to be supplied at any summarisation phase.

So in a constructor, for example, or when trying to prevent mistakes from creating a complex object

by supplying the parameters that we need to supply in a different order than the one that is expected.

And also when trying to avoid unreadable code that is caused by big constructors, when those big constructors

are needed in order to create some really, really complicated objects in our program.
